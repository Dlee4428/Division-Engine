// WHAT TCS DOES
// Level of detail (determining the tessellation level) and view frustum culling are performed in the tessellation control shader. 
// Level of detail is calculated based on the projected screen size of a sphere fitted to each patch edge.
// Frustum Culling is performed by testing the bounding sphere of the patch against the view frustum planes.
